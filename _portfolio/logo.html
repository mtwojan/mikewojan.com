        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>When I decided to create a logo, I knew I wanted something simple that speaks to my identity and design process. After sketching out a few dozen ideas, I realized that part of my design process itself, paper prototyping, lent itself pretty well to the symmetry in my initials. I found myself folding a strip of paper into an interlocked M and W, which is what sparked my new idea. I also liked that the shape subtly hints at an infinity symbol, which represents the iterative nature of my work and how I often go back to the drawing board to incorporate feedback from my users.</p>

      <p>I tried a few iterations without color to give my logo an origami feel. I liked this approach but ended up favoring the additional contrast that some color affords. I chose blue for my primary color because it represents professionalism and trust, and a seafoam teal accent that stands apart just enough while still complementing the rest of the cool color palette.</p>
