        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I recently signed up for the <a href="http://www.dailyui.co/">Daily UI</a> challenge. I've always enjoyed mobile design in particular, so many of my Daily UI mockups focus on native app interactions and wearable tech. Here are some of my favorite designs so far.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-section">
      <img src="/../img/dailyui/boarding-pass.png" alt="boarding pass mockup" class="personal-project-image">
      <p>For my boarding pass design, I focused on highlighting the most important information for the user, including which pieces they'd want to see pop up on their watch.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-section">
      <img src="/../img/dailyui/trip-selection.png" alt="mockup of an app for browsing and purchasing outdoor trips" class="personal-project-image">
      <p>For my shopping experience app, I designed something I’d personally love to use: a tool for discovering and booking outdoor travel with friends. I think it would be a fun way to organize trips for hiking, camping, biking, kayaking, etc.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-section">
      <img src="/../img/dailyui/settings-page.png" alt="mockup of a page for managing your mobile app settings" class="personal-project-image">
      <p>For my settings page, I worked on a few improvements to the Uber preferences screen. I designed new ways to manage your favorite places and payment profiles, friend and family accounts, music preferences, and driver notifications. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-section">
      <img src="/../img/dailyui/transaction-mockups.png" alt="mockup of an app for browsing your credit card transactions" class="personal-project-image">
      <p>Transaction history: design a screen for tracking your credit card transactions. In this design I focused on the financial components I’m most interested in seeing at a glance: how much money did I spend, at what locations, and how much cash back did I receive? I designed a Snapchat-like scroll bar for easily navigating months along the right side.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-section">
      <img src="/../img/dailyui/weather-popup.png" alt="mockup of new functionality for the apple weather app" class="personal-project-image">
      <p>I’ve always thought the 3D touch functionality of Apple’s weather app is lacking. I designed a new screen that would show the current conditions at your favorite locations and provide links to commonly used functionality inside the app.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-section">
      <img src="/../img/dailyui/account-switcher.png" alt="mockup of new interaction for switching accounts in the gmail app" class="personal-project-image">
      <p>Instead of designing a mobile menu, I focused on a specific new interaction for the Gmail menu. I’ve always found it tedious switching between my personal and work accounts in the app. I envisioned an interaction where you hold down on the hamburger menu and slide your thumb over to the account picture you’d like to switch to. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-section">
      <img src="/../img/dailyui/email-receipt.png" alt="mockup of a new email receipt from amazon" class="personal-project-image">
      <p>For the email receipt challenge, I designed some improvements to the Amazon shipment confirmation. Overall my experience ordering with Prime has been great, but I’ve always thought their confirmation emails look pretty barbaric for being such a prevalent company.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-section">
      <img src="/../img/dailyui/welcome-screen.png" alt="mockup of a welcome screen for a photography app" class="personal-project-image">
      <p>Challenge: design an app’s welcome screen that introduces the user to your product. I’m an avid photographer and have always wished there was an app to help me transfer, organize, edit, and share photos from my DSLR all in one place.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-section">
      <img src="/../img/dailyui/netflix.png" alt="mockup of the netflix app for xbox one console" class="personal-project-image">
      <p>For my TV app design, I decided to focus on some improvements to the Netflix app for a gaming console. It’s fun to take advantage of the additional buttons and inputs that a game controller affords, like assigning a dedicated search function to the “Y” button. This design also comes with the recommendation that Peaky Blinders uses this picture of my roommate and I on Halloween for their Netflix cover photo.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-section">
      <img src="/../img/dailyui/spotify-watch.png" alt="mockup of four screens for the spotify app on the apple watch" class="personal-project-image">
      <p>Challenge: design a music player. Well, there are plenty of music apps out there. Spotify has been making progress on their Apple Watch app, but I've always thought they could do more with it. Wouldn't it be cool to cast your music to your Amazon Echo or living room stero with the tap of a button on your wrist?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-section">
      <img src="/../img/dailyui/illustration-set.png" alt="a set of photography illustrations" class="personal-project-image">
      <p>I designed my illustration set around one of my favorite hobbies: photography. I set out all my camera equipment on the dining room table and created a flat representation of each object. This was a fun and challenging topic because of the complex shapes and textures in photography accessories. </p>
