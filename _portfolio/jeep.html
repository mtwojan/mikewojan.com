        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I've always been interested in automotive UX. When I was a kid I was always playing around in the passenger seat with Mom or Dad's entertainment system. Today Iâ€™m just trying to turn on the heat and rear window defrost. Instrument clusters and infotainment systems present a lot of interesting challenges. Eventually after struggling with a number of interactions in my new Jeep Cherokee, I decided to mock up some possible solutions to the problems. </p>
